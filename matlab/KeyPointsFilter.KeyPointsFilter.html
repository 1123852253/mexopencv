      <div class="helpcontent"><p>Methods to filter a vector of keypoints.</p>

<p>A keypoint is a data structure for salient point detectors.</p>

<p>The struct stores a keypoint, i.e. a point feature found by one of many
available keypoint detectors, such as Harris corner detector, <a href="FAST.html">cv.FAST</a>,
<a href="StarDetector.html">cv.StarDetector</a>, <a href="SURF.html">cv.SURF</a>, <a href="SIFT.html">cv.SIFT</a>, <a href="FeatureDetector.html">cv.FeatureDetector</a> etc.</p>

<p>The keypoint is characterized by the 2D position, scale (proportional to
the diameter of the neighborhood that needs to be taken into account),
orientation and some other parameters. The keypoint neighborhood is then
analyzed by another algorithm that builds a descriptor (usually
represented as a feature vector). The keypoints representing the same
object in different images can then be matched using
<a href="DescriptorMatcher.html">cv.DescriptorMatcher</a> or another method.</p>

<p>The keypoint struct contains the following fields:
* <strong>pt</strong> coordinates of the keypoint <code>[x,y]</code>.
* <strong>size</strong> diameter of the meaningful keypoint neighborhood.
* <strong>angle</strong> computed orientation of the keypoint (-1 if not applicable);
it's in [0,360) degrees and measured relative to image coordinate
system, ie in clockwise.
* <strong>response</strong> the response by which the most strong keypoints have been
selected. Can be used for the further sorting or subsampling.
* <strong>octave</strong> octave (pyramid layer) from which the keypoint has been
extracted.
* <strong>class_id</strong> object class (if the keypoints need to be clustered by an
object they belong to).</p>
