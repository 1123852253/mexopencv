      <div class="helpcontent"><p>Calculates the distance to the closest zero pixel for
each pixel of the source image</p>

<pre><code> dst = <a href="distanceTransform.html">cv.distanceTransform</a>(src)
 dst = <a href="distanceTransform.html">cv.distanceTransform</a>(src, 'DistanceType', distanceType, ...)
 [dst, labels] = <a href="distanceTransform.html">cv.distanceTransform</a>(...)
</code></pre>

<h2> Input</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>src</strong> 8-bit, single-channel (binary) source image.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Output</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>dst</strong> Output image with calculated distances. It is a 32-bit
floating-point, single-channel image of the same size as src.</li>
<li><strong>labels</strong> Optional output 2D array of labels (the discrete Voronoi diagram).
It has the type int32 and the same size as src</li>
</ul>

<h2> Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>DistanceType</strong> Type of distance. It can be 'L1', 'L2' , or 'C'</li>
<li><strong>MaskSize</strong> Size of the distance transform mask. It can be 3, 5, or
'MaskPrecise' (the latter option is only supported by the
first function). In case of the 'L1' or 'C' distance type, the
parameter is forced to 3 because a 3 x 3 mask gives the same
result as 5 x 5 or any larger aperture.</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions distanceTransform calculate the approximate or precise distance
from every binary image pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image
pixels, the distance will obviously be zero.</p>

<p>When MaskSize is 'MaskPrecise' and DistanceType is 'L2', the
function runs the algorithm described in [Felzenszwalb04].</p>

<p>In other cases, the algorithm [Borgefors86] is used. This means that for a
pixel the function finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel
consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or knight's move
(the latest is available for a  mask). The overall distance is calculated as
a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be
symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost
(denoted as a ), all the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as
b ), and all knight's moves must have the same cost (denoted as c ). For the
'C' and 'L1' types, the distance is calculated precisely, whereas for 'L2'
(Euclidian distance) the distance can be calculated only with a relative
error (a 5 x 5 mask gives more accurate results). For a, b, and c,
OpenCV uses the values suggested in the original paper:</p>

<pre><code> 'C'   3 x 3    a = 1,     b = 1
 'L1'  3 x 3    a = 1,     b = 2
 'L2'  3 x 3    a = 0.955, b = 1.3693
 'L2'  5 x 5    a = 1,     b = 1.4,    c = 2.1969
</code></pre>

<p>Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation 'L2', a 3 x 3 mask is
used. For a more accurate distance estimation 'L2', a 5 x 5 mask or the
precise algorithm is used. Note that both the precise and the approximate
algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.</p>

<p>The second variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance
for each pixel (x, y) but also identifies the nearest connected component
consisting of zero pixels. Index of the component is stored in labels(x, y).
The connected components of zero pixels are also found and marked by the
function.</p>

<p>In this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides
a very fast way to compute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image. Currently,
the second variant can use only the approximate distance transform algorithm.</p>
