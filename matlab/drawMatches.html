      <div class="helpcontent"><p>Draws the found matches of keypoints from two images</p>

<pre><code>im = <a href="drawMatches.html">cv.drawMatches</a>(im1, keypoints1, im2, keypoints2, matches1to2)
im = <a href="drawMatches.html">cv.drawMatches</a>(..., 'OptionName', optionValue, ...)
</code></pre>

<h2> Input</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>im1</strong> First source image.</li>
<li><strong>keypoints1</strong> Keypoints from the first source image.
A 1-by-N structure array. It has the following fields:<ul>
<li><strong>pt</strong> coordinates of the keypoint [x,y]</li>
<li><strong>size</strong> diameter of the meaningful keypoint neighborhood</li>
<li><strong>angle</strong> computed orientation of the keypoint (-1 if not applicable).
Its possible values are in a range [0,360) degrees. It is measured
relative to image coordinate system (y-axis is directed downward),
ie in clockwise.</li>
<li><strong>response</strong> the response by which the most strong keypoints have been
selected. Can be used for further sorting or subsampling.</li>
<li><strong>octave</strong> octave (pyramid layer) from which the keypoint has been
extracted.</li>
<li><strong>class_id</strong> object id that can be used to clustered keypoints by an
object they belong to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>im2</strong> Second source image.</li>
<li><strong>keypoints2</strong> Keypoints from the second source image. Same as <code>keypoints1</code></li>
<li><strong>matches1to2</strong> Matches from the first image to the second one, which
means that <code>keypoints1(i)</code> has a corresponding point in
<code>keypoints2(matches(i))</code></li>
</ul>

<h2> Output</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>im</strong> Output image. Its content depends on the option values defining
what is drawn in the output image. See possible options below.
By default, the two source images, matches, and single
keypoints will be drawn. For each keypoint, only the center point
will be drawn (without a circle around the keypoint with the
keypoint size and orientation).</li>
</ul>

<h2> Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>MatchColor</strong> Color of matches (lines and connected keypoints). If
all -1, random colors are picked up. default [-1,-1,-1,-1].</li>
<li><strong>SinglePointColor</strong> Color of single keypoints (circles), which means
that keypoints do not have the matches. If all -1, random colors
are picked up. default [-1,-1,-1,-1].</li>
<li><strong>MatchesMask</strong> Mask determining which matches are drawn. If the mask
is empty, all matches are drawn. default empty.</li>
<li><strong>NotDrawSinglePoints</strong> Single keypoints will not be drawn. default
false.</li>
<li><strong>DrawRichKeypoints</strong> For each keypoint, the circle around keypoint
with keypoint size and orientation will be drawn. default false.</li>
</ul>
