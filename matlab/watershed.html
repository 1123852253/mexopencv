<pre><code>marker = <a href="watershed.html">cv.watershed</a>(image, marker)
</code></pre>

<h2> Input</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>image</strong> Input 8-bit 3-channel image.</li>
<li><strong>marker</strong> Input 32-bit single-channel image (map) of markers. It
should have the same size as image.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Output</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>marker</strong> Output 32-bit single-channel image (map) of markers. It has
the same size as image.</li>
</ul>

<p>The function implements one of the variants of watershed, non-parametric
marker-based segmentation algorithm, described in [Meyer92].</p>

<p>Before passing the image to the function, you have to roughly outline the
desired regions in the image markers with positive (&gt;0) indices. So, every
region is represented as one or more connected components with the pixel
values 1, 2, 3, and so on. Such markers can be retrieved from a binary mask
using findContours() and drawContours() (see the watershed.cpp demo). The
markers are seeds of the future image regions. All the other pixels in
markers , whose relation to the outlined regions is not known and should be
defined by the algorithm, should be set to 0's. In the function output, each
pixel in markers is set to a value of the seed components or to -1 at
boundaries between the regions.</p>

<h2> Note</h2>

<p>Any two neighbor connected components are not necessarily separated by
a watershed boundary (-1's pixels); for example, they can touch each other in
the initial marker image passed to the function.</p>
